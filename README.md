## Queue Lab  
In this lab you will implement a class to model a queue data structure. This is an independent lab.  

## Set Up
<ol>
	<li>Create new anaconda environment using these commands</li>
	<ul>
		<li>conda create --name queue_lab python=3.13.1</li>
		<li>conda activate queue_lab</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Pull starter code from GitHub Classroom</li>
	<li>Open in VS code and switch to the character_check_lab anaconda environment</li>
	<li>When the lab is complete, push code to GitHub Classroom</li>
</ol>

## Instructions
A queue is a FIFO structure. Similar to standing in line in the cafeteria, the first person in the line, is the first person to move out of the line and be served. 

In this lab:
<ol>
  <li>Create a class called GanoLine that will represent a queue.</li>
  <li>Add any attributes needed to keep track of the people in the line.</li>
  <li>Create a push method that adds a person to the queue/ Gano line.</li>
  <li>Create a pop method that removes a person from the queue/ Gano line.</li>
</ol>
