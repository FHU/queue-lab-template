## Queue Lab  
This is an independent lab.  

A queue is a FIFO structure. Similar to standing in line in the cafeteria, the first person in the line, is the first person to move out of the line and be served. 

In this lab:
1. Create a class called GanoLine that will represent a queue.
2. Add any attributes needed to keep track of the people in the line.
3. Create a push method that adds a person to the queue/ Gano line.
4. Create a pop method that removes a person from the queue/ Gano line.
